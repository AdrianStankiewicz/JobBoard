# JobBoard

## About
At first this project was supposed to be just for university classes as a simple MongoDB database, but I want to try to expand it into a webapp to learn more about working with MongoDB using C# and MongoDBDriver. 

The app is is a job board, where companies can post job offers for people to browse and apply for job offers, with an ability to review the recruitment process and overall job experience.

## Structure
The database consists of 6 Collections:
- users (registered users)
- brands (information about companies posting offers)
- offers (posted job offers)
- reviews (user submitted reviews about their experience with companies)
- applications (user submitted applicatrions for job offers)
- technologies (TODO, will be used for position requirements standarization)
